# Android-Development-Java-Kotlin-

I'm thrilled to share that I have embarked on an exciting journey to master Android development using both Java and Kotlin. As of June 26, 2024, I have enrolled in the Udemy course, "The Complete Android 15 Course - Build 82 Apps [Java & Kotlin]." This comprehensive program delves deep into every aspect of Android development, from the fundamentals to the most advanced techniques.

I am eagerly looking forward to laying a strong foundation in mobile app development and applying this knowledge to create innovative and impactful Android applications. Thank you for your support as I take on this new challenge!
