# Android-Development-Java-Kotlin-

I'm excited to announce that I've started learning Android development using Java and Kotlin from the Udemy course "The Complete Android 15 Course - Build 82 Apps [Java & Kotlin]" as of June 26, 2024. This comprehensive course covers everything from the basics to advanced features of Android development. I'm looking forward to building a solid foundation in mobile app development and creating innovative Android applications.
